# Cybersecurity Portfolio â€“ SOC Analyst Projects
Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio. This repo showcases hands-on SOC analyst workflows using Splunk SPL queries, simulated alert logic, and incident response documentation. Built entirely with free tools to demonstrate real-world detection skills and Security+ principles.

##  Repository Structure
- `linux-practice/` â€“ Terminal commands and file system navigation
- `log-analysis/` â€“ Exercises using grep, tail, and auth.log
- `splunk-queries/` â€“ Sample SPL queries for anomaly detection
- `incident-scenarios/` â€“ Mock investigations and response notes
- `study-guides/` â€“ Security+ notes and cheat sheets

##  SPL Query Library
- [Anomaly Detection Queries](./splunk-queries/anomaly-detection.md)

##  Alert Logic Simulations
- Brute Force Detection (Splunk SPL)
- IP Anomaly Detection
- Access Control Violations
 
## ðŸ”— Additional SOC Use Cases
- [Brute Force Detection Alert](./splunk-queries/brute-force-alert.md)
- [Phishing Case Investigation](./incident-scenarios/phishing-case.md)
- [Failed Login Drill](./log-analysis/failed-login-drill.md)

##  Incident Reports
- Simulated investigations with MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- Linux log analysis and response documentation

##  Skills Demonstrated
- Splunk Core User certified SPL logic
- Security+ principles: access control, encryption, threat detection
- MITRE ATT&CK alignment
- SOC alert configuration and triage
- GitHub repo management and documentation

##  Certifications
- CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701)
- Splunk Core User

##  About This Repo
This portfolio was built without paid tools or enterprise accessâ€”just Splunk knowledge, Linux logs, and strategic thinking. It reflects my ability to detect, investigate, and document threats in a SOC environment.

##  How to Use This Repo
Start with the [Anomaly Detection Queries](./splunk-queries/anomaly-detection.md) to see my SPL logic.  
Then explore the [Brute Force Detection Alert](splunk-queries/brute-force-alert.md) and ## Log Analysis Exercises
[Failed Login Investigation Drill](./log-analysis/failed-login-drill.md)
 for real-world simulations.
