# Cybersecurity Portfolio – SOC Analyst Projects
Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio. This repo showcases hands-on SOC analyst workflows using Splunk SPL queries, simulated alert logic, and incident response documentation. Built entirely with free tools to demonstrate real-world detection skills and Security+ principles.

##  Repository Structure
- `linux-practice/` – Terminal commands and file system navigation
- `log-analysis/` – Exercises using grep, tail, and auth.log
- `splunk-queries/` – Sample SPL queries for anomaly detection
- `incident-scenarios/` – Mock investigations and response notes
- `study-guides/` – Security+ notes and cheat sheets

##  SPL Query Library
- [Anomaly Detection Queries](./splunk-queries/anomaly-detection.md)

##  Alert Logic Simulations
- Brute Force Detection (Splunk SPL)
- IP Anomaly Detection
- Access Control Violations
 
## 🔗 Additional SOC Use Cases
- [Brute Force Detection](./splunk-alerts/brute-force.md)
- [Access Control Violations](./splunk-alerts/access-control.md)
- [Incident Report – Linux Auth Log](./incident-scenarios/linux-auth-report.md)

##  Incident Reports
- Simulated investigations with MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- Linux log analysis and response documentation

##  Skills Demonstrated
- Splunk Core User certified SPL logic
- Security+ principles: access control, encryption, threat detection
- MITRE ATT&CK alignment
- SOC alert configuration and triage
- GitHub repo management and documentation

##  Certifications
- CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701)
- Splunk Core User

##  About This Repo
This portfolio was built without paid tools or enterprise access—just Splunk knowledge, Linux logs, and strategic thinking. It reflects my ability to detect, investigate, and document threats in a SOC environment.

##  How to Use This Repo
Start with the [Anomaly Detection Queries](./splunk-queries/anomaly-detection.md) to see my SPL logic.  
Then explore the [SOC Use Cases](./splunk-alerts/brute-force.md) and [Incident Reports](./incident-scenarios/linux-auth-report.md) for real-world simulations.
